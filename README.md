# BidConnect Platform

## Overview
BidConnect is a **full-stack freelance project bidding platform** designed to connect **employers** who have projects with **freelancers** looking for work.  
It streamlines the process of posting projects, receiving competitive bids, and hiring the right talent â€” all in a secure, role-based environment.

On the **employer** side, users can create detailed project listings with clear descriptions, budgets, and timelines. Employers can then review all bids submitted by freelancers, compare offers, and make informed hiring decisions.  

On the **freelancer** side, users can browse available projects, submit tailored bids that include price, estimated delivery time, and a personalized cover letter. Freelancers can also view their own bid status for each project theyâ€™ve applied to.  

The application is built with **React** for the frontend, **Node.js + Express** for the backend, and **MongoDB Atlas** for database storage.  
Security is enforced using **JWT-based authentication** and **role-based access control (RBAC)**, ensuring that employers and freelancers have access only to the features relevant to their roles.

BidConnectâ€™s clean and modern interface ensures ease of use, while backend validations and error handling provide a smooth and reliable user experience.
